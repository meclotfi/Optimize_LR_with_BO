# Optimize_LR_with_BO

 A program that aim to find the optimal learning rate of a small ResNet for classifying images (Fashion-MNIST) 
 using Bayesian Optimization (BO) as a global optimization approach

## How to run the program ?

The program can be run using the Colab notebook in this link. In the notebook, this repos is cloned and 
the functions defined in it are used to run the optimization loop and show all the plots during 
the progress of the method (observations, the posterior mean, uncertainty estimate and the acquisition function) 

## Exemple of the plots
